We study the association between investor sentiment and investors’ demand for dividends before the ex-dividend day in China, a country in which unsophisticated, retail investors dominate the stock market. We find that the demand for dividends is higher when sentiment is low, implying that dividends are perceived as a “safe” source of cash that is particularly valuable when investors are pessimistic. The demand is weaker when investors are distracted by contemporaneous dividend announcements and when alternative safe assets such as housing and gold are performing well. Our findings suggest that the dividend-capture activities of retail investors vary with the overall market sentiment and that they are likely driven by psychological factors.

**2. Dividend Changes, Reference Points and Stock Market Reactions**\

A firm’s dividend payment represents a significant reference point for investors that tends to be more intense the longer the firm has maintained it. This paper studies the relation between reference point intensity and reactions to dividend cuts, and the conditions that have an impact on this relationship. We find that high-intensity reference points are more relevant than low-intensity ones in the sense that they result in dividend cuts being punished more by investors. For individual firms, the intensity of the reference point is directly reduced if firms choose to increase dividends before cuts. More generally, economic recessions or paying dividends late compared to others in the same quarter both weaken the relevance of the intensity. The weakening is potentially due to investors focussing more on current dividends in bad states of the world or reference points being updated. The findings suggest that ingrained reference points make dividend cuts worse, but more importantly, these impacts can be mitigated in certain circumstances.


**3. Corporate Payout Initiations: A Puzzle**\

Despite declining profitability and increased investment demands, many newly listed firms initiate payouts soon after going public. Focusing on US IPOs from 1980 to 2017, our paper attempts to understand the underlying motivations prompting IPO firms to initiate dividends and share repurchases. With a focus on market reaction to dividend cuts and the importance of reference points, we find that firms may interpret the potential drawbacks of dividends as a way to signal strength and stability, prompting them to adopt a proactive stance towards initiation. This study enhances our comprehension of corporate dividend dynamics while advocating for prudence in dividend initiation to mitigate unforeseen future expenses.
