I am currently a Visiting Scholar and Teaching Assistant at Alliance Manchester Business School, University of Manchester, where I also earned my PhD in Finance.
My research interests lie in empirical corporate finance and behavioural finance. Much of my work leverages large financial datasets and cross-sectional econometric methods to investigate how investors behave and how corporations make financial decisions across financial markets in different countries.
