excerpt: 'Despite declining profitability and increased investment demands, many newly listed firms initiate payouts soon after going public. Focusing on US IPOs from 1980 to 2017, our paper attempts to understand the underlying motivations prompting IPO firms to initiate dividends and share repurchases. With a focus on market reaction to dividend cuts and the importance of reference points, we find that firms may interpret the potential drawbacks of dividends as a way to signal strength and stability, prompting them to adopt a proactive stance towards initiation. This study enhances our comprehension of corporate dividend dynamics while advocating for prudence in dividend initiation to mitigate unforeseen future expenses.'
