excerpt: 'We study the association between investor sentiment and investors’ demand for dividends before the ex-dividend day in China, a country in which unsophisticated, retail investors dominate the stock market. We find that the demand for dividends is higher when sentiment is low, implying that dividends are perceived as a “safe” source of cash that is particularly valuable when investors are pessimistic. The demand is weaker when investors are distracted by contemporaneous dividend announcements and when alternative safe assets such as housing and gold are performing well. Our findings suggest that the dividend-capture activities of retail investors vary with the overall market sentiment and that they are likely driven by psychological factors.'
