excerpt: 'A firmâ€™s dividend payment represents a significant reference point for investors that tends to be more intense the longer the firm has maintained it. This paper studies the relation between reference point intensity and reactions to dividend cuts, and the conditions that have an impact on this relationship. We find that high-intensity reference points are more relevant than low-intensity ones in the sense that they result in dividend cuts being punished more by investors. For individual firms, the intensity of the reference point is directly reduced if firms choose to increase dividends before cuts. More generally, economic recessions or paying dividends late compared to others in the same quarter both weaken the relevance of the intensity. The weakening is potentially due to investors focussing more on current dividends in bad states of the world or reference points being updated. The findings suggest that ingrained reference points make dividend cuts worse, but more importantly, these impacts can be mitigated in certain circumstances.'
